Test

CAREFUL !!! The CM_SM.bin that is not in specified dbm folder is 16dbm !!!
No transmission occured during 15dbm
>Packet receive and transmit perfectly at close distance but RSSI and SNR value is much higher than 
expected. There should be a lot of loss for the RSSI and SNR value.

FSM working as expected
>Start in Rx mode with no timeout
>Waiting for command "A"
>Go into Tx mode, transmit "ABC...T" (20bytes)
